I am an oceanographer and atmospheric scientist by training and, as such, my research focuses on the interactions of the ocean, atmosphere, and cryosphere within climate as an integrated system. My primary research interests revolve around the role of air-sea-ice interactions and their teleconnections in weather and climate variability across a range of spatial and temporal scales. I am particularly interested in using coupled numerical models and statistical tools to improve our understanding of the climate system including questions of predictability and long-term trends.

Currently, I am working as a Postdoctoral Investigator with [Dr. Hyodae Seo](https://hseo.whoi.edu/) in the Physical Oceanography Departement at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.
